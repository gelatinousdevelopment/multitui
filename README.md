Sandbox claude code, codex, gemini, or any TUI on macOS without changing your workflow.

[Multitui](https://multitui.com) **protects your filesystem** when running untrusted code by creating highly-customizable individual **macOS terminal apps** for your favorite TUI and command line programs.

## Why Multitui?

- **Sandbox:** Your filesystem, your rules. Multitui uses the macOS built-in `sandbox-exec` to give you total control over what files the TUI can see, read, and edit. Run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` without worrying about your filesystem outside of your project folder.
- **Keep your dev environment:** You don't need to launch a container or VM.
- **Native apps:** Fast and efficient, native Swift app. Native integrations, like Finder toolbar button, recent documents, customizable toolbar, global shortcut, and dock icon.
- **Built for power users:** Extensive options to build apps for your favorite tools and your unique workflow.
